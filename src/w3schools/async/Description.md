# JS Async 

## Callbacks

* "I will call back later!"

* A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

* This technique allows a function to call another function

* A callback function can run after another function has finished

## Asynchronous JavaScript

* "I will finish later!"

* Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

* A good example is JavaScript setTimeout()

## JavaScript Promises

* "I Promise a Result!"

* "Producing code" is code that can take some time

* "Consuming code" is code that must wait for the result

* A Promise is a JavaScript object that links producing code and consuming code

* The reason why Promise is more preferable to Callback is readability.

## JavaScript Async

* "async and await make promises easier to write"

* async makes a function return a Promise

* await makes a function wait for a Promise
