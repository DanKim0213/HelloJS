# JavaScript HTML DOM

* With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document. 
* DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.
* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
* The HTML DOM Tree of Objects

## HTML DOM Events

* Events: onclick, onchange, onload
* Event Listeners: addEventListener(), removeEventListener()
* Advantages of addEventListener():
    > You can add many event handlers to one element.

    > The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling.

    > The JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup, for better readability 
    
    > The addEventListener() allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup.
